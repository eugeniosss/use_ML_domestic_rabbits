# Rabbit Genomes & Morphology Machine Learning

This repository contains scripts, notebooks, and toy datasets related to my PhD work on **rabbit genomes** and **morphology**.  
The main purpose is **exploratory analyses** and **learning machine learning techniques** (e.g., scikit-learn, PyTorch) applied to genomic and morphological data.

## Goals
- Process genomic (SNPs, alleles) and morphological data into machine learningâ€“ready formats.  
- **Genomic analyses**: classify rabbits as **domestic vs. wild** using ML models.  
- **Morphological analyses**: predict **age** and **geographic coordinates** (latitude & longitude) from features.  
- Experiment with models:
  - Logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks.  
- Track preprocessing, train/validation/test splits, feature scaling, batch normalization, and early stopping.  

## Notes
- Repo is mainly for **personal use and experimentation**.  
- Datasets are small or synthetic unless otherwise noted.  
- Code evolves as I test approaches combining genomic and morphological data.  
- Both **scikit-learn** and **PyTorch** are used for comparison and practice.
