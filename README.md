# Rabbit Genomes Machine Learning

This repository contains scripts, notebooks, and toy datasets related to my personal PhD work on rabbit genomes.  
The main purpose of this repo is **exploratory analyses** and **learning machine learning techniques** (e.g., scikit-learn, PyTorch) applied to genomic data.

## Goals
- Practice going from genomic data (SNPs, alleles) → machine learning–ready formats.  
- Experiment with simple models (logistic regression, random forests, neural nets).  
- Keep track of preprocessing functions and small test datasets.  

## Notes
- This repo is mainly for **personal use and experimentation**.  
- Datasets are small dummy examples unless otherwise noted.  
- Code will evolve as I learn and test new approaches.
